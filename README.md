## Features
### PCB
Hot swappable switches through mill-max sockets
<br> Arduino Micro
<br> 3d printable case

### Case
Screws aren't visible on the front
<br> Flush design

## Parts List
1 Printed case (top + bottom)
<br> 1 PCB
<br> 1 Arduino micro
<br> 2 Screws of any kind as long as they fit
<br> 6 Bumpons to put on the bottom of the case
<br> 6 mechanical switches of any kind
<br> 12 mill max hotswap sockets

## Assembly
### Assembling the PCB
1 - First, gather the Arduino micro and PCB. They must be assembled together
<br> 2 - The Arduino must be placed UNDERNEATH the pcb, meaning it will be facing upside down. Solder all the pins to join the PCB and Arduino and then snip off the excess pin header coming from the Arduino micro.
<br> 3 - (Optional but very strongly recommended) If desired, place mill max sockets in each of the pins that the mechanical switches go and use a little bit of solder to seal them in. If not using mill max sockets, wait to solder the switches as that will be the last step.

### Putting Everything Together
1 - First, place the arduino into the top housing 
<br> 2 - Second, press the bottom housing into the top housing
<br> 3 - Join the 2 pieces together with the two screws
<br> 4 - Place the bumpons on the bottom of the keypad
<br> 5 - Upload the code to the arduino and get to using the macropad!
